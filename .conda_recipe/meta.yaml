  description: |
    The Bayesian Gene Heritability Analysis software (BAGHERA) estimates the contribution
    to the heritability of a trait/disease of all the SNPs in the genome (genome-wide heritability)
    and those nearby protein-coding genes (gene-level heritability).
    BAGHERA requires only summary statistics from a Genome-wide Association Study (GWAS),
    LD scores calculated from a population matching the ethnicity of the GWAS study
    and a gene annotation file in GTF format.
